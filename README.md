# 🐸 Hi, I’m @maddipaddi

## Things to know about me:

- My name is Madelen, but I go as Maddie. 
- I thrive on creativity and problem-solving, and really enjoy how code can bring order to chaos.
- I’m a somewhat silly 28-year old.
- Pronouns she/her.
- Can’t sit on a chair properly.
- Norwegian living in Norway. Hip-hip-hooray for socialism and seasonal depression!
- When I'm not buried in code, I'm likely out climbing, reading, or exploring the great outdoors with a camping or packrafting trip.
